# Product Requirements Document: Grid-Based Life Simulator

## 1. Objective

To create a passive, observational life simulation game where players can watch the emergent behavior of a simple ecosystem. The simulation will feature animals with basic needs and plants that grow, all within a 2D grid-based world. The player's role is purely that of an observer, with no ability to influence the simulation.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Grid-Based World

- The world will be represented by a 2D grid.
- Each cell in the grid can contain one or more entities (e.g., an animal, a plant).
- The world will be procedurally generated at the start of the simulation, with a mix of terrain types (e.g., ground, water).

### 2.2. Entities

#### 2.2.1. Animals

- Animals are autonomous agents that move around the grid.
- They have the following basic needs, which deplete over time:
    - **Hunger:** Decreases over time. If it reaches zero, the animal dies.
    - **Thirst:** Decreases over time. If it reaches zero, the animal dies.
    - **Sleep/Energy:** Decreases as the animal moves and performs actions. If it reaches zero, the animal must sleep.
- To fulfill their needs, animals will seek out and consume resources:
    - **Food:** Animals will eat plants to reduce their hunger.
    - **Water:** Animals will drink from water sources to reduce their thirst.
    - **Sleep:** Animals will find a suitable location and sleep to regain energy.
- Animals have a finite lifespan and will die of old age, in addition to starvation or dehydration.
- Dead animals will be removed from the simulation.

#### 2.2.2. Plants

- Plants are stationary entities that serve as a food source for animals.
- Plants will grow over time, potentially increasing in size or nutritional value.
- Plants can spread to adjacent, unoccupied grid cells.

### 2.3. Simulation Engine

- The simulation will run in discrete time steps (ticks).
- In each tick, the state of all entities and the environment will be updated.
- The engine will manage entity AI, including pathfinding for animals to locate resources.

### 2.4. User Interface

- The primary UI will be a visual representation of the grid and the entities within it.
- The UI will display basic statistics about the simulation, such as:
    - The number of living animals.
    - The number of plants.
    - The current simulation time/tick.
- The player will have no direct control over any aspect of the simulation. They are a passive observer.

## 3. Gameplay Loop

1. The simulation begins with a procedurally generated world containing a starting population of animals and plants.
2. The simulation progresses in ticks. With each tick:
    - Animals' needs (hunger, thirst, energy) decrease.
    - Animals with critical needs will attempt to find and move towards the nearest resource (food, water).
    - Once a resource is reached, the animal will consume it, and the corresponding need will be replenished.
    - Animals that need to sleep will become stationary for a period to regain energy.
    - Plants will grow and may spread to new cells.
    - Animals whose needs are not met will die and be removed.
3. The simulation continues indefinitely, allowing the player to observe the long-term evolution of the ecosystem.

## 4. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

- Animal reproduction.
- Predator-prey relationships.
- More complex animal behaviors (e.g., social interactions, territory).
- Seasons and weather that affect the environment and entity behavior.
- A wider variety of plant and animal species.
